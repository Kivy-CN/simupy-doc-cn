A system in a `BlockDiagram` needs to provide the following attributes:



* `dim_state` : the dimension of the state
* `dim_input` : the dimension of the input
* `dim_output` : the dimension of the output
* `output_equation_function` : A callable returning the system output.



If `dim_state`=0, then `output_equation_function` recieves the current time and input as arguments during integration. If `dim_state`>0 then `state_equation_function`, taking the current time, state, and input and returning the state derivative, must also be provided. In this case, `output_equation_function` recieves the current time and state as arguments during integration.

If `event_equation_function` and `update_equation_function` are provided, discontinuities at zero-crossing of `event_equation_function` are handled. The argument rules for `event_equation_function` and `update_equation_function` during integration are the same as for `output_equation_function` and `state_equation_function`, respectively. Generally, `update_equation_function` is used to change what `state_equation_function`, `output_equation_function`, and `event_equation_function` compute based on the occurance of the discontinuity. If `dim_state`>0, `update_equation_function` must return the state immediately after the discontinuity.

The base system class takes a convenience input argument, `dt`. Passing `dt`>0 will determine the sample rate that the outputs and state are computed; `dt`=0 is treated as a continuous-time system. In hybrid-time `BlockDiagram`s, the system is automatically integrated piecewise to improve accuracy.

Future versions of SimuPy may support passing jacobian functions to ode solvers if all systems in the `BlockDiagram` provide the appropriate necessary jacobian functions.

A quick overview of the of the modules:



`block_diagram` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/block_diagram.html))

implements the `BlockDiagram` class to simulate interconnected systems.

`systems` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/systems.html))

provides a few base classes for purely numerical based systems.

`utils` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/utils.html))

provides utility functions, such as manipulating (numeric) systems and simulation results.

`systems.symbolic` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/symbolic_systems.html)) and `discontinuities` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/discontinuities.html))

provides niceties for using symbolic expressions to define systems.

`array` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/array.html)) and `matrices` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matrices.html))

provide helper functions and classes for manipulating symbolic arrays, matrices, and their systems.

`utils.symbolic` ([docstrings](https://simupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/symbolic_utils.html))

provides utility symbolic functions, such as manipulating symbolic systems.
